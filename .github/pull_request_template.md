# Registry Update Checklist

Registry:
- [ ] I've made the organization @eliza-plugins
- [ ] I've used github not github.com
- [ ] There is no .git extension
- [ ] It's placed it alphabetically in the list
- [ ] I've dealt with commas properly so the list is still valid JSON

If not an eliza-plugins official repo, i.e. new plugin: 

The plugin repo has:
- [ ] is publically accessible (not a private repo)
- [ ] uses main as it's default branch
- [ ] I have include `elizaos-plugins` in the topics in the GitHub repo settings. If the plugin is related to `AI` or `crypto`, please add those as topics as well.
- [ ] add simple description in github repo
- [ ] follows this convention
